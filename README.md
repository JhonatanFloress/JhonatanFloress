# Hi there! 👋

I’m **Jhonatan**, a backend developer based in Mexico City 🇲🇽.  

I love building scalable, secure, and efficient backends with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, designing RESTful APIs, and working with databases. I’m passionate about turning ideas into robust solutions that help teams deliver high-quality software.  

Outside of code, I enjoy learning new technologies, exploring anime, and constantly improving my skills through personal projects.  

I’ve worked with tools like **IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Git, and Bitbucket**, and I’m experienced in managing backend services and database integrations with **MySQL, Oracle SQL, and MongoDB**.
